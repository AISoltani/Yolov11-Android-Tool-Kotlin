# Yolov11-Android-Tool-Kotlin
YOLO Object Detection and Segmentation using TensorFlow Lite in Kotlin
This is an Android Studio project utilizing Kotlin and TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) to implement YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and segmentation. The project aims to provide a lightweight and efficient solution for on-device computer vision tasks.

Features
- Real-Time Object Detection: Perform fast and accurate object detection using a TFLite YOLO model.
- Segmentation: Includes segmentation capabilities to differentiate object boundaries.
- Kotlin Implementation: Fully implemented in Kotlin for seamless Android integration.
- User-Friendly Interface: Minimal setup for easy use and extension.
- On-Device Processing: No network dependencyâ€”ideal for privacy-focused applications.
